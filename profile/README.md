## Key Features

- 🔐 Encryption of vector and raster layers  
- 🗺 Support for common GIS formats (SHP, GeoJSON, TIFF, MBTiles)*  
- 🧭 Layer/attribute access policies and role-based control  
- 📦 Protected map packages and deployment keys generation  
- 🔑 HW/SW licenses, offline activation, license leasing  
- 📝 Operation logs and integrity checks for releases  

\* format availability depends on license bundle.
